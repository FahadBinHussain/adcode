 * The admin gate has two different refusals to tell apart.
 *
 * "Not an admin account" is an answer. An API that did not answer is not, and reading
 * the failure as `isAdmin: false` told the founding administrator she was not one while
 * every admin endpoint would still have accepted her. These render the real `AdminShell`
 * with a stubbed auth state, so the copy and the retry are checked where they are used.
