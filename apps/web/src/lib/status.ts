/**
 * The public status page's data.
 *
 * Same shape and the same rule as `releases.ts`: read from the API so an incident posted
 * from the admin panel appears without a deploy, revalidated rather than cached forever,
 * and failing to null rather than to an error. A status page that 500s because its own
 * API is unreachable is worse than one that says so in a sentence.
 *
 * The shapes and parser live in `statusView.ts`, which has no imports, because the
 * header's live status is a client component and cannot pull in `next/cache` through
 * this file. They are re-exported here so the page and its tests keep one import.
